# fbLogin-Swift
integrating facebook login into iOS using Swift

Step 1 :
Set up the basic app details on facebook and install the ios SDK from the facebook developers site. The tutorial on doing this step is explained well at https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios/getting-started/

Step 2: 
Since we are using Swift and the SDK provided by facebook is for objective-C, we need a .h file for bridging objective C and swift.
We shall name this file as bridge-header.h
